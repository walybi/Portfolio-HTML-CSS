        <p> Originally from Burkina Faso, a small country located in west Africa, I moved to the US in 2012
            after
            completing my high school degree. Coming to America, I did not know any English but I was, as always
            eager to learn and in three months I was able to stand in front of a class to give a speech about my
            country. </p>
        <br>
        <p> I spent my first three months in the US in a college town called Eugene, in Oregon. Then I moved to
            New
            York where I spent the next seven years going to school. I first studied English for another three
            months, then I started my academic program in Electronics engineering Technology at the city
            university
            of New York in the Bronx. I graduated in May 2015 and pursued a Bachelor in electrical Engineering
            at
            the State University of New York at New Paltz. I graduated from New Paltz in May 2019. One month
            later,
            I decided to leave New York and adventure in the west coast precisely in Seattle, WA. </p>
        <br>
        <p> Why Seattle? A simple google search showed that Seattle is one of the fast growing city in the US
            with
            lots of tech Jobs. Plus I have visited the city before moving to New York and also in spring 2016
            and I
            fell in love with the nice views, the nice weather and the modern houses. So, Without hesitation, I
            packed my staff and took off. </p>
        <br>
        <p> Once in Seattle, I found out that most of the high paying jobs are in the programming world, plus I
            have
            always wanted to learn how to code. So I decided to go for a coding Bootcamp and the only one
            flexible
            with my schedule was the UW-Bootcamp. </p>
        <br>
        <p> I hope to get out of this program competitively ready to embrace the job market.</p>
