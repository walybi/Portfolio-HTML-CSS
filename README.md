            ## Description
This project is about creating a simple and basic portfolio to showcase some basic `HTML` and `CSS` skills. I use `flex-box` extensively in order to make the pages somewhat responsive.

There are three differents html files.One about me, the second one about projects to showcase and a contact page for the user to be able to get in touch.

            ## Motivation
As a web developer, I want a portfolio to showcase my applications to potential employers and clients.

            ## Technologies

Project is created using :

- HTML
- CSS (Used a lot of flex-box layout and positionning)
